## Review

I highly recommend this course to anybody looking to sharpen their skills as a React developer!

Coming in to this course, I already had a fair amount of experience and proficiency with React. With that being said, I still found this course to be extremely valuable. Coding through these projects will offer you a lot of opportunities for repetition and deeply understanding the flow of React fundamentals.

If you haven't used React before, the Feedback App project is a great place to start. You will learn how to create components, pass & utilize props, and implement & manage state. Later on in the project, you will refactor your component level state to be used globally through the use of the Context API.

The GitHub Finder project further explores the management of app level state by introducing actions and reducers. Did you know you can utilize actions and reducers with the Context API? The explanations here are thorough, insightful, and will make understanding third party state management libraries (such as Redux) much easier.

In this project, the actions and reducers are used to effectively fetch data from the GitHub API and persist it to global state. Also, as an added bonus, you will learn how to set up Tailwindcss and configure customizations and plugins in a React app!

And finally, the House Marketplace app will introduce considerations for large scale full stack apps built with React. If you haven't used Firebase before, prepare yourself to learn a LOT about it's capabilities as a platform for user authentication, cloud file storage, and a dedicated NoSQL database. This project is quite long and in-depth, so be sure to take your time and read through documentation for all of the tools used.

The styles used for this project all come from a single pre-made index.css file rendered at the app level. I think this is okay in the context of this project, as it is already quite long and writing out styles for each component would have made it significantly longer. I do think that if you were hoping to learn more about best practices for styling within React, you will probably have to look elsewhere.

At the time of writing this review, Brad has mentioned a possible fourth project that will be added to the course, but it has not yet been added.

Overall I was very happy with the course and I found it well worth the time and money spent!
